# PWM (STM32F429I-DISC1, hybrid)

TIM3 channel 1 (PA6) generates a 10 kHz PWM signal at 50 % duty; after starting it the firmware idles, with no LED or UART feedback.

Only part of the hardware is modeled: `tim3_model.c`: TIM3.

The peripherals that have no model run on the real board: FastDyn forwards
their accesses over the ST-LINK while the board runs the idle firmware.
Connect the board over USB and flash the idle firmware once:

```bash
../../idle_firmware/flash.sh
```

The firmware reports its result on the board's LEDs LD3 (green, PG13) and LD4
(red, PG14). In the MMIO trace they are writes to GPIOG: `ODR` (`0x40021814`,
bit `0x2000` LD3, `0x4000` LD4) or `BSRR` (`0x40021818`: `0x00002000` turns LD3
on, `0x20000000` off; `0x00004000` / `0x40000000` the same for LD4).

All commands run from this folder.

## Build the models

```bash
boardrunner build-models generated_models -o build
```

## Run

No input is needed.

```bash
boardrunner run -c pwm_config.toml    # Ctrl-C after about 8 s
```

The run's files, including its MMIO trace `fastdyn_work/io.log` (`[elder]` lines are the
models, `[passthrough]` lines the board), are in `fastdyn_work/`.

## What to expect

```bash
grep "\[elder\] Write.*address = 0x40000400" fastdyn_work/io.log | grep -oE "value = 0x[0-9a-f]+" | tail -1   # 0x00000081: counter enabled
```
